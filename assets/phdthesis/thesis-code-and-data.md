# Jordy Van Landeghem's PhD thesis on Intelligent Automation for AI-Driven Document Understanding

This document contains the source code for my PhD thesis on Intelligent Automation for AI-Driven Document Understanding. The thesis was defended on 2024-03-12 at KU Leuven, Belgium. The public defense was 2024-04-23.

The thesis is written in LaTeX and the source code is available in a repository upon demand. 
For each of the chapters, I will link to the data, models, and code that was used to generate the results in the thesis.
