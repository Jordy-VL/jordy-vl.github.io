# Intelligent Automation

 ## 14-12-2020


Idea for reviewing Intelligent Automation

"swapping two vowels has never been as impactful"

1. General
2. Chapter by Chapter
3. Hats
    3.1 AI researcher 
    3.2 AI project lead/manager
    3.3 AI engineer
    3.4 Looking for IA, e.g. innovation manager
4. Reading tips 

My two cents

Not sure if we should promote Mark Twain in these recent times, but still he shares one outright idea with Intelligent Automation: 

“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.” – Mark Twain
Mistakes during automation! 
False positives are the true enemy
