# Master thesis supervision 

Since in 2016 I have had a wonderful master thesis internship at Oracle in Barcelona thanks to Jan Van Sas, I want to similarly give back to the community.
From multiple universities in Belgium (and hopefully soon abroad) I have organised and helped guide each year multiple master thesis internships:
