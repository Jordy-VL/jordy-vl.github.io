#### <u>Predictive Uncertainty for Probabilistic Novelty Detection in Text Classification</u>
*This paper experimentally reports on Bayesian predictive uncertainty for real-world text classification tasks. We compare Bayesian Deep Learning methods in text classification and define a straightforward protocol to evaluate the quality of uncertainty estimates. We report on Monte Carlo Dropout-based model and data uncertainties using 1-D convolutional neural networks on multi-class news topic and sentiment classification datasets. We find that our protocol effectively enables to test for novelty detection robustness showing that Bayesian quantities underestimate uncertainty and predictive entropy demonstrates superior performance.*
